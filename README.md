# Challenge-2

## DESCRIPTION

Every programmer needs an online portfolio that showcases their work for potential employers. Here I used HTML and CSS to create a responsive layout to display my current and future projects. In the top position of the webpage you will find an enlarged image with a link to the Horiseon code refactor from the previous project

## Installation

If you're reading this, that means you already have access to the code pushed to git

However, if it looks like there is something we missed or could improve upon, feel free to clone this repository by clicking the green 'clone' button on the git, and copying the SSH key from the drop down menu. Once you've copied the SSH key you will need to go into your terminal and type 'git clone', paste the key, and hit enter.

Congrats! You've successfully made a working directory! This allows you to make alterations/additions to our code on your own local device.

## Credits

I would like to thank all the teaching staff, my classmates, and Al Gore, without whom none of this would have been possible
